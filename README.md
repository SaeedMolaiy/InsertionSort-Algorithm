# Insertion Sort Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in C#. Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## Algorithm Overview

Insertion Sort works by repeatedly taking an unsorted element and inserting it into its correct position within the sorted part of the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the algorithm works:

1. Start with the second element.
2. Compare the current element with the previous elements in the sorted part of the array.
3. Swap elements until the current element is in its correct position.
4. Move to the next unsorted element and repeat the process.
5. Continue until the entire array is sorted.
